Installation

IllegalMap is a ChatTriggers module that scans each Dungeon to give extra information to the user, like which rooms and puzzles are in the dungeon and exactly how many secrets there are before the dungeon even starts. The map also shows the user other useful information like the total secrets, death penalties, crypts, mimic and the current score right underneath the map so that the user never needs to look at the tab list. IllegalMap can be used on its own as your primary dungeon map, with significantly more features than any other map currently. IllegalMap is highly customizable through the /dmap command.



Dungeon Preview
IllegalMap automatically scans the dungeon as soon as you enter it. After the dungeon has been fully scanned (And the chunks all loaded), it will stop scanning. By default, all of the rooms before the dungeon begins will be shown clearly, but once the dungeon starts all of the unexplored rooms will be darkened so that they can be distinguished from already explored rooms. There is an option to show room names and secrets all the time in the Config gui (/dmap), however if you want a cleaner looking map it is recommended to use the "Peek Rooms" keybind which will only show room names while the key is being held.

  
Dungeon Info
IllegalMap shows important info about the dungeon underneath the map (By default) including found-remaining-total secrets, crypts, minimum secrets, score pentalty for deaths, the current score and the mimic status (See screenshots from Dungeon Preview). The dungeon info can also be configured to display seperately from the map, or remain under the map during clear and seperate upon entering boss.
